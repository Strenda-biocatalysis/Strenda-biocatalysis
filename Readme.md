# Welcome to STRENDA biocatalysis guidelines

STRENDA biocatalysis is aiming to define which ATTRIBUTES should be used to describe an experiment in biocatalysis. Since biocatalysis is a dicipline with many different operational modes, it is very overwhelming to hand out one document to describe all possible experimental setups. On the contrary, we need a catalogue that adapts to the experimental procedures to help experimenters in their everyday work and give software developers a basis for data modelling. For this reason, we subdivided the whole catalogue into six main CATEGORIES and build it in a adaptive modular way.

Therefore, on this website, you find the ATTRIBUTES (metadata) organised in this six main CATEGORIES which are visualised as icons below. Please click on the icons to open the next level and review the ATTRIBUTES. 

## How to use STRENDA biocatalysis

- use [this]() tool to define your ATRRIBUTES set


# Here, you can find our CATEGORIES and ATTRIBUTES

## Operation mode

The operation mode is the first step in the experimental planning, it describes the mode in which the experiment was perform (e.g. batch, fed-batch, continuous)
