# Welcome to STRENDA biocatalysis guidelines

Welcome to the STRENDA biocatalysis guidelines online catalogue, a comprehensive resource for the standardized collection of enzymatic reaction metadata. 

This catalogue offers researchers and scientists in the field of biocatalysis a structured platform to access and contribute metadata crucial for understanding enzymatic transformations. STRENDA biocatalysis aims to define which ATTRIBUTES should be used to describe an experiment in biocatalysis. Exactly for this, the following catalogue was designed and built in an adaptive modular way. While the primary focus remains on enzymatic transformations themselves, the broader landscape of biocatalysis, including aspects such as product purification, analytics, and experimental processes, is also acknowledged. These complementary aspects of biocatalysis, though essential, are not within the scope of this first version of the STRENDA biocatalysis guidelines. It's important to note that not all attributes are required for every experiment. Decision trees indicating mandatory attributes will be provided in the future. Currently, our focus is on compiling a comprehensive list of all attributes.

Feel free to explore the valuable information in this catalogue and join in standardizing enzymatic reaction data. On this website, the ATTRIBUTES (metadata) are organised in following six main CATEGORIES which are visualised as icons. Please click on the icons below to open the next level and review the ATTRIBUTES.

# CATEGORIES and ATTRIBUTES

## Operation mode

The operation mode is the first step in the experimental planning, it describes the mode in which the experiment was performed (e.g. batch, fed-batch, continuous)

## Vessel type and mixing (hydrodynamics)

When discussing enzymatic reactions, it's essential to address the vessel type and its influence on mixing and hydrodynamics.

## (Bio)catalyst

Closely examining the role of the biocatalyst is a fundamental aspect in the context of enzymatic reactions.

## Components

Exploring the components involved in the reaction mixture is essential for a comprehensive understanding of enzymatic reactions.

## Reaction conditions

Examining the reaction conditions provides critical insights into the enzymatic reaction process.
